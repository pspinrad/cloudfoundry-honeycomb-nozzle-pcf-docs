This documentation describes the Honeycomb Nozzle for Pivotal Cloud Foundry

parses all the messages it finds there, and sends them to the Honeycomb service,
https://honeycomb.io. In addition to the PCF-generated logs, application logs
that appear as JSON objects will be parsed and included, so you can explore your
application's performance using Honeycomb.
