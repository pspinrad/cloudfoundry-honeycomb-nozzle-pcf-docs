##<a id='install'></a> Install and Configure Honeycomb Nozzle for PCF

### Create an account on Honeycomb

Before starting to install the Tile, create an account on https://honeycomb.io by going to https://honeycomb.io/signup

Once you have created an account, get your Team Write Key from https://ui.honeycomb.io/account

### Create system accounts so the Nozzle has access to the firehose

There are two options for creating credentials that can talk to the API:
* UAA API user account (**strongly recommend** - choose this route unless you have a reason not to)
* UAA Client

#### UAA API User Account

Create a UAA user with access to the Firehose and Cloud Controller:

* Install the UAA CLI, uaac.
```
gem install cf-uaac
```

* Use the uaac target uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN command to target your UAA server.
```
uaac target uaa.sys.example.com
```

* Record the uaa:admin:client_secret from either
    * The cf deployment manifest or
    * The Ops Manager UI, click on Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile, go to credentials tab, UAA -> Admin Client Credentials

* Authenticate to UAA using the client_secret from the previous step
```
uaac token client get admin -s ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET
```

* Create a Honeycomb Nozzle user with the password of your choosing.
```
uaac -t user add honeycomb-nozzle-user --password PASSWORD --emails na
```

* Add the user to the Cloud Controller Admin Read-Only group.
```
uaac -t member add cloud_controller.admin_read_only honeycomb-nozzle-user
```

* Add the user to the Doppler Firehose group.
```
uaac -t member add doppler.firehose honeycomb-nozzle-user
```

#### UAA Client

Create a UAA client with access to the Firehose and Cloud Controller:

* Install the UAA CLI, uaac.
```
gem install cf-uaac
```

* Use the uaac target uaa.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN command to target your UAA server.
```
uaac target uaa.sys.example.com
```

* Record the uaa:admin:client_secret from either
    * The cf deployment manifest or
    * The Ops Manager UI, click on Pivotal Elastic Runtime tile, go to credentials tab, UAA -> Admin Client Credentials

* Authenticate to UAA using the client_secret from the previous step
```
uaac token client get admin -s ADMIN-CLIENT-SECRET
```

* Create a new UAA client for your firehose
```
uaac client add honeycomb-nozzle \
    --access_token_validity 1209600 \
    --authorized_grant_types authorization_code,client_credentials,refresh_token \
    -s <SECRET> \
    --scope openid,oauth.approvals,doppler.firehose \
    --authorities oauth.login,doppler.firehose
```

For information about creating a UAA user, see the [Creating and Managing Users with the UAA CLI](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/adminguide/uaa-user-management.html) topic.
